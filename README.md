_HONGEET is a **local-first music app** that lets you  
**stream** and **download** music with maximum control — no ads, no trackers, no nonsense._

Built for people who care about **audio quality**, **performance**, and **ownership**.


## 📖 Whats HONGEET?

HONGEET was built to solve a simple problem:

> *“Why is it so hard to just listen to music the way **I** want?”*

Most music apps:
- lock downloads behind paywalls
- restrict quality
- track users aggressively
- break when you go offline

HONGEET does the opposite.

It runs a **local backend inside the app**, streams directly from the source, and lets **you** decide what happens to your music.
